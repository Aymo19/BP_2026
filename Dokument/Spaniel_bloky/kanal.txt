custom AWGN kanal

	It is an AWGN channel (Additive White Gaussian Noise, in baseband). It receives the complex envelope of a digitally modulated signal. 
The block has two outputs: out0, out1.

OUT0 delivers the same received signal but with additive white Gaussian noise with different power values that correspond to different Es/No values; 

OUT1 delivers an Es/No value applied to each out0 sample. 

This block differs from other traditional AWGN channel blocks in the following: 
	Signal Power:
		It has an internal function that measures the average power of the incoming signal Ps, so that it can calculate 
											
														Es = Ps / Rs 

	Noise Power:
		By varying the noise power Pn, the Es/No ratio can be varied so that it takes N possible values between EsN0min and EsN0max.
					
											Es/N0 € <Es/N0min ; Es/N0max>, size = N
											
												-menime len N0, Es je konstantny

With this, the first test has been completed so that another block can calculate the BER Curve. But it doesn't stop there; it continues performing as many tests as 
the simulation time allows, so that the block that calculates the BER curve can continually refine it.

Block configuration data:
	N: 		 The number of discrete points the BER curve will have. It also corresponds to the number of values the Es/No ratio will take.
	EsN0min: The minimum value to consider for Es/No.
	EsN0max: The maximum value to consider for Es/No.
	Rs: 	 The symbol rate.
	B: 		 A characteristic of the incoming signal; it corresponds to the sampling frequency of the incoming signal and can be greater than or equal to Rs.
	Es: 	 The energy of a symbol.

Input signals:
	IN0: Complex envelope of a digitally modulated signal.

Output Signals:
	OUT0: This  is the channel output, that is, the same incoming signal but with noise added to satisfy a certain Es/No ratio.
	OUT1: This is the Es/No value applied to the current output.

Some internal variables are:
	No: 	This is the power spectral density of the white noise.
	SNR-Db: This is the signal-to-noise ratio in dB.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
	* We wonder if this block shouldn't be called e_canal_BER, since it doesn't represent bits or any relation to them, just symbols. 
  	  The more appropriate name would be e_canal_EsN0.
	
	* This block doesn't know the number of bits per symbol, so it can't determine the Eb/No ratio, and all it calculates is the BER relative to Es/No.
	
	* The Complex Envelope can have multiple samples per symbol (Sps), for example when it has passed through a Wave Forming block, 
  	  so SampRate can be greater than or equal to Rs. SampRate=Rs*Sps. 
      The problem is that in this case, the out0 output will also have Sps values per symbol, which must be taken into account by the blocks that use this signal.
	
	* Es is calculated as: Es = Ps x Ts, where Ps is the average power of the incoming signal (measured internally) and Ts is 
	  the duration of each symbol or Ts = 1 / Rs. We understand that this implies imagining the symbols as rectangular, 
	  which can be valid when the incoming signal brings digital modulation based on constellation points, such as BPSK, QPSK, MPSK, MQAM. 
	  In other words, it is an idealization designed into a BER Curve analysis tool to compare different types of modulation under similar conditions.
	  

KOD:

	## This is where the problem lies and can be better optimized.
	## Something that could be done is to pay more attention to the high Es/No values, which is where it is most difficult to obtain the BER
	## Apparently the easy way to do this is to
	## make the EsN0dB vector keep changing, since it is static and defines which EsN0dB values to use. 
	## Another aspect that could be improved is that: the blocks that 
	## benefit from this block have to convert what we give them to a vector of size N. For that grace,
	## it would be convenient to require that the signals entering and exiting this block be of vector type, with size N. 
	## I assume that since we already have a fixed value for L=N, we will free ourselves from the for and if clauses below.
